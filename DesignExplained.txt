Quick explanantion of my design:
-I initally considered using the full screen for the website before deciding that a container was the better option here
as everything will be displayed in the center of the screen this way, making it easier to take in the information on the site
in my opinion (less eye/head movement required to take it all in)

-I chose variations of grey for the backgrounds and added orange elements throughout. I decided on grey because to me, it 
communicates "clean and professional". I used orange elements on the site to communicate creativity to those browsing the site
and thinking of joining Colmar Academy.

-For the section of the site containing the courses, I used a stock photo of a university from pexels.com as the background.
I did this to add a bit more color to the site and to make it a bit more interesting/exciting.

-I also used minor animations throughout the site in order to make it come to life.
